<h1>Triple-Dipped Fried Chicken</h1>
<p>This fried chicken batter yields the crispiest, spiciest, homemade fried chicken I have ever tasted! It has been a picnic favorite in my family for years and tastes equally good served hot or cold.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>4 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons garlic salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups beer, or as needed</li>
    <li>2 egg yolks, beaten</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Mix 3 cups flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, paprika, and poultry seasoning together in a medium bowl.</p>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Stir 1 1/2 cups beer, remaining 1 1/3 cups flour, egg yolks, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in a separate bowl; thin with more beer if batter is too thick.</p>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Moisten chicken pieces with a little water, then dip in seasoned flour mixture. Shake off excess and dip in beer batter, then dip in the seasoned flour mixture once more.</p>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Lower chicken pieces carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until crispy and well-browned, about 15 to 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</p>
